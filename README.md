# JS-Print-Screen
This task sets to print certain strings of words out on the screen of our browser, using Javascript

(The simplicity of this task is making me scared whether I'm doing the right thing but we meuuuve.)
I used the alert method for now because the console was giving me headache. I used variables and concatenated the variables using "+"
TO enter a new line in the alert box, use "/n". I wanted to use it but it was messing up my code.

After cloning from a remote github repo and you want to push to github, just type "git push". No extra.
The END.
