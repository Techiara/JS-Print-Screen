# JS-Print-Screen


I used the alert method for now because the console was giving me headache. I used variables and concatenated the variables using "+"
TO enter a new line in the alert box, use "/n".

After cloning from a remote github repo and you want to push to github, just type "git push". No extra.
The END.
